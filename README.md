# my_2048

1. Make main_menu_screen with optional grid sizes (anything else fun, maybe triple, double score values for fast games)
2. Update game screen (win/lost box (medal or something / something funny about losing and go again btn ))
3. Add music/audio (mediaval tavern/ relaxing shooting) How much memory it takes, git allows under 1MB per file

BUG: When pushing new game then the generated tiles don't show up (easy fix, reload page again)
